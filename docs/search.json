Whether in life or research, we’re often interested in relationships between 2+ variables. For example, how is one’s commute time to class related to their distance from campus and mode of transportation? Or, how is voter participation related to a person’s age and political affiliation? Statistical modeling is the art and science of turning data into information about such relationships of interest.\nBeing able to summarize, interpret, and communicate about data are crucial for navigating today’s information landscape, and these are precisely the skills that we’ll build in this class. Throughout the semester, we’ll study the fundamental methods that statisticians use to extract knowledge from data, emphasizing statistical literacy & intuition, real data applications, and modern computing over memorizing facts and formulas."

You can call me Bill or Professor Billah & I use he/him pronouns. Back when I was an undergrad student, I didn’t have the best experience in Intro Stat—those courses often emphasized formulas over real understanding. That experience has shaped my teaching—I concentrate on illustrating how statistical theories connect and can be applied in the real world. I’m excited to teach STAT 155 and to create a more meaningful experience—one that helps all students feel confident applying it beyond the classroom. My methodological research lies at the intersection of statistical genetics, biostatistics, and genomics. My current research interests include developing novel statistical methods and computationally efficient bioinformatics tools, leveraging modern machine- and deep-learning approaches analyze high-dimensional next-generation sequencing and multi-omics data to identify genes and regulatory mechanisms underlying complex diseases. Outside of my academic work, I enjoy spending time outdoors with family and friends or cooking variety of foods. If you can’t find me anywhere, I might be busy playing soccer or exploring new worlds on my PS5 Pro!\n\n\nOffice hours:\n\nLocation: My office (OLRI 234) and over zoom, password: 123456\nTimes: M/W: 12:00pm - 12:30pm (in-person), T/TR: 2pm - 3pm (Over zoom, password: 123456)\nBy Appointment: I’m also happy to meet one-on-one if my normal drop-in/virtual hours don’t work for you.

    "text": "Late work on Practice Problems (PPs)\nThroughout the semester, you may use up to three, three-day extensions. These three extensions can be used on Practice Problems only, not quizzes. The purpose of deadlines (and extensions) are to keep you accountable for your own learning, to keep you on track with the pace of the course (which builds upon itself throughout the semester), and to provide preceptors and myself with the ability to provide you with timely feedback on assignments. Since the Problem Sets are due roughly every two weeks, you must begin working on them early if you want to succeed.\nExtensions can be used automatically, without letting me know in advance. The Moodle dropboxes for assignments will close exactly 3 days after the original deadline (i.e. Mondays at 11:59pm), and I will not accept work submitted after that point unless there are extenuating circumstances that you have communicated with me about ahead of the original deadline. If you email me a completed assignment after a 3-day extension is up, I may have the preceptors provide you with feedback, but you will not receive credit for the assignment (equivalent to “Needs Improvement” on every question of the relevant assignment).\nI expect you to keep track of how many extensions you’ve used. I will do my best to email you a reminder if you have used all three of your extensions and have none remaining.\nIf you have run out of extensions and/or an extenuating circumstance occurs that impacts your ability to submit assignments on time, please email me to discuss the situation. I am happy to be flexible as long as you communicate!"

To help make this happen, I am committed to the following.\nRespect: Everyone comes from a different path through life, and it is our moral duty as human beings to listen to each other without judgment and to respect one another. I have no tolerance for discrimination of any kind, in and out of the classroom. If you are seeking campus resources regarding discrimination, the Department of Multicultural Life and the Center for Religious and Spiritual Life are wonderful resources. We will also respect the MSCS Community Guidelines.\nSensitive Topics: Applications in this course span issues in science, policy, and society. As such, we may sometimes address sensitive topics. I will try to announce in class if an assignment or activity involves a potentially sensitive topic. If you have reservations about a particular topic, please come talk to me to discuss possible options.\nAccommodations: If you need accommodations for any reason, please contact Disability Services to discuss your needs, and speak with me as soon as possible afterwards so that we can discuss your accommodation plan. If you already have official accommodations, please discuss these with me within the first week of class so that you get off to a great start. Contact me if you have other special circumstances. I will find resources for you.\nTitle IX: You deserve a community free from discrimination, sexual harassment, hostility, sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking. If you or anyone you know has experienced harassment or discrimination, know that you are not alone. Macalester provides staff and resources to help you find support. Please be aware that as a faculty member, it is my responsibility to report disclosure about sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, relationship violence, and stalking to the Title IX Office. The purpose of this report is to ensure that anyone experiencing harm receives the resources and support they need. I will keep this information private, and it will not be shared beyond this required report.\nYou may also contact Macalester’s Title IX Coordinator directly (phone: 651-696-6258; e-mail: titleixcordinator@macalester.edu); they will provide you with supportive measures, resources, and referrals.

Investing time into taking care of yourself will have profound impacts on all aspects of your life. Remember that beyond being a student, you are a human being carrying your own experiences, thoughts, emotions, and identities. It is important to acknowledge any stressors you may be facing, which can be mental, emotional, physical, cultural, financial, etc., and how they can have an impact on you. I encourage you to remember that you have a body with needs. In the classroom, eat when you are hungry, drink water, use the restroom, and step out if you are upset and need some air. Please do what is necessary so long as it does not impede your or others’ ability to be mentally and emotionally present in the course. Outside of the classroom, sleeping well, moving your body, and connecting with others can be strategies can help nourish you. If you are having difficulties maintaining your well-being, please don’t hesitate to contact me and/or find support from physical and mental health resources here, here, and here."

Our goal is to understand the relationship of home Price ($) with Living.Area, the size of a home in square feet.\n\nFit a linear regression model of Price by Living.Area, and call this model home_mod.\n\n\n# Fit the model\n\n\n# Display model summary output\n\n\nInterpret the intercept and the coefficient for Living.Area. Is the interpretation of the intercept meaningful?\nWe can use a location transformation on Living.Area to “start” it at a more reasonable value. We can see from the summarize() code below that the smallest house is 616 quare feet, so let’s center this predictor at 600 square feet. There is no code to fill in here, but make note of the mutate() syntax.\n\n\nhomes %&gt;% \n    summarize(min(Living.Area))\n## # A tibble: 1 × 1\n##   `min(Living.Area)`\n##                &lt;dbl&gt;\n## 1                616\n\n# What is mutate() doing???\nhomes &lt;- homes %&gt;%\n    mutate(Living.Area.Shifted = Living.Area-600)\n\n\nWe can actually determine the coefficients of the Price ~ Living.Area.Shifted model by hand.\n\nFirst, write out in general terms (without specific numbers) how we would interpret the intercept and slope in this model.\nUse these general interpretations as well as the summary output of home_mod to determine what these new coefficients should be.\n\nNow check your answer to part d by fitting the model.\n\n\n# Fit a model of Price vs. Living.Area.Shifted\n\n\n# Display model summary output\n\n\nSo we now have 2 models of Price by the size of a home, as measured by Living.Area and Living.Area.Shifted:\n\n\nE[Price | Living.Area] = 13439.394 + 113.123 Living.Area\nE[Price | Living.Area.Shifted] = 81312.919 + 113.123 Living.Area.Shifted\n\nAs indicated by the equal slopes but differing intercepts, these models simply have different locations:\n\n# Don't worry about the code!!\nhomes %&gt;% \n  select(Price, Living.Area, Living.Area.Shifted) %&gt;% \n  pivot_longer(cols = -Price, names_to = \"Predictor\", values_to = \"Size\") %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(y = Price, x = Size)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) + \n  facet_wrap(~ Predictor)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantly, they produce the same predictions!

Then the Big Mac Index is 6.70/5.58 = 1.20, and is the implied exchange rate between Swiss franc and USD.\nIf you’d like to read more about the Big Mac index, here’s an article in The Economist (this may be behind a pay-wall for you, you can read up to 5 free articles in the Economist per month).\nFor this exercise, we’ll use the bigmac data (collected in 2006) to explore the relationship between average teaching salary in a country and the amount of time someone needs to work to be able to afford a Big Mac.

The amount of time it takes to earn a Big Mac is very high when income is below about 10,000 where it sharply decreases, and then decreases at a much lower rate when income is above around 20,000.\n\nCorrelation is a summary of the linear relationship between two quantitative variables, and this relationship does not appear to be linear!\n\n\n\n# Linear regression code\nmod &lt;- lm(bigmac_mins ~ gross_annual_teacher_income, data = bigmac)\nsummary(mod)\n## \n## Call:\n## lm(formula = bigmac_mins ~ gross_annual_teacher_income, data = bigmac)\n## \n## Residuals:\n##     Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n## -29.649  -9.556  -1.784   4.512  43.715 \n## \n## Coefficients:\n##                               Estimate Std.

Stated differently, a ten-thousand dollar increase in gross annual teacher income is associated with a 9 minute decrease in the average number of minutes it takes to earn a Big Mac (note that here I did a scale transformation of gross annual teacher income to get this interpretation, which might make more sense when looking at the scale of salary!).\n\n\n\n\n# Residuals vs. fitted values plot\nggplot(mod, aes(x = .fitted, y = .resid)) + \n    geom_point() + \n    geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +\n    geom_smooth(se = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe residuals vs. fitted values plot shows a very clear, nonlinear pattern! As fitted values increase, residuals decrease for a while, and then sharply increase once fitted values are higher than around 40 minutes. The spread of residuals around zero also varies, with greater spread for higher fitted values.\n\nThe residuals appear to be large for people with negative fitted values and those with very high fitted values. Recall that a linear model does not “know” that number of minutes to earn a Big Mac can’t be negative, in context. If we look at the fitted line from our linear model on a scatterplot (see below)…\n\n\nbigmac %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = gross_annual_teacher_income, y = bigmac_mins)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe observe that negative fitted values and very large fitted values occur when annual teacher income is greater than around 70,000 and less than 10,000, respectively. This implies that the model does a worse job at predicting the number of minutes to earn a Big Mac in countries where annual teacher income is either very high or very low.\nWe’ll now consider a log transformation of teaching salary. In the code chunk below, create a new variable called log_sal that contains the logged values of gross_annual_teacher_income.\n\n# Creating new variable log_sal\nbigmac &lt;- bigmac %&gt;%\n  mutate(log_sal = log(gross_annual_teacher_income))\n\n\n\n\n\nbigmac %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(log_sal, bigmac_mins)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe relationship between logged annual teaching salary and minutes to earn a Big Mac appears roughly linear, with a weakly negative relationship. Correlation is likely an appropriate numerical summary for the relationship between these two quantitative variables, as the relationship is roughly linear!\n\n\n\n\nmod_log &lt;- lm(bigmac_mins ~ log_sal, data = bigmac)\nsummary(mod_log)\n## \n## Call:\n## lm(formula = bigmac_mins ~ log_sal, data = bigmac)\n## \n## Residuals:\n##     Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n## -36.817  -6.951  -1.241   6.032  41.357 \n## \n## Coefficients:\n##             Estimate Std.

Suppose we have two salaries: Salary1 and Salary2. If Salary2 is 10% higher than Salary1, then Salary2/Salary1 = 1.1. It is a property of logarithms that log(Salary2/Salary1) = log(Salary2) - log(Salary1). In this case log(Salary2/Salary1) = log(Salary2) - log(Salary1) = log(1.1) = 0.09531018. So a 10% increase in salary is a 0.09 unit increase in the log scale:\n\n# Multiplicative difference of 1.1, or 10% between salaries gives us the \nlog(1.1) * -18.142\n## [1] -1.729117\n\nWhile a 1 unit increase in log salary is associated with an average decrease of 18 Big Mac minutes, a 0.0953 unit increase in log salary (which corresponds to a 10% multiplicative increase), is associated with a 1.7 minute decrease in Big Mac minutes.\nUnderlying math:\nCase 1: Salary = x\n   E[bigmacmin_1] = beta0 + beta1 log(x)\nCase 2: Salary = m*x\n   E[bigmacmin_2] = beta0 + beta1 log(m*x)\n\nE[bigmacmin_2] - E[bigmacmin_1] = beta1 log(m)\n\n\n\n\n# Residuals vs. fitted values plot\nggplot(mod_log, aes(x = .fitted, y = .resid)) + \n    geom_point() + \n    geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +\n    geom_smooth(se = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe residuals seem to lie roughly around zero for all possible fitted values, though the spread is still noticably larger for larger fitted values compared to smaller ones. This implies that the linearity assumption is likely satisfied for this model, but equal variance may be a concern.",

Correlation can range from -1 to 1, where a correlation of 0 indicates that there is no linear relationship between the two quantitative variables.\nBelow is an example of a “Math Box”. You’ll see these occasionally throughout the activities. You are not required to memorize, nor will you be assessed on, anything in the math boxes. If you plan on continuing with Statistics courses at Macalester (or are interested in the math behind everything!), these math boxes are for you!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrelation\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Pearson correlation coefficient, \\(r_{x, y}\\), of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) is the (almost) average of products of the z-scores of variables \\(x\\) and \\(y\\):\n\\[\nr_{x, y} = \\frac{\\sum z_x z_y}{n - 1}\n\\]\n\n\n\nIn general, we will want to be able to describe (qualitatively) two aspects of correlation:\n\nStrength\n\n\nIs the correlation between x and y strong, or weak, i.e. how closely do the points fit around a line? This has to do with how dispersed our point clouds are.\n\n\nDirection\n\n\nIs the correlation between x and y positive or negative, i.e. does y go “up” when x goes “up” (positive), or does y go “down” when x goes “up” (negative)?\n\nStronger correlations will be further from 0 (closer to -1 or 1), and positive and negative correlations will have the appropriate respective sign (above or below zero).\nWhiteboard Time (a little-bit!)\n\n# correlation\n\n# Note: the order in which you put your two quantitative variables into the cor\n# function doesn't matter!

This has to do with how dispersed our point clouds are.\n\n\nDirection\n\n\nIs the correlation between x and y positive or negative, i.e. does y go “up” when x goes “up” (positive), or does y go “down” when x goes “up” (negative)?\n\nStronger correlations will be further from 0 (closer to -1 or 1), and positive and negative correlations will have the appropriate respective sign (above or below zero).\n\nRather than a smooth trend line, we can force the line we add to our scatterplots to be linear using geom_smooth(method = 'lm'), as below:\n\n\n# scatterplot with linear trend line\nlifts %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = BodyweightKg, y = SWR)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the above scatterplot, how would you describe the correlation between body weight and SWR, in terms of strength and direction?\nMake a guess as to what numerical value the correlation between body weight and SWR will have, based on your response to part (b).",

So far, ggplot has chosen the line for us. How does it know which line is “best”, and what does “best” even mean?\nFor this exercise, we’ll consider the relationship between x1 and y1 in the anscombe dataset. Run the following code, which creates a scatterplot with a fitted line to our data using the function geom_abline:\n\n# scatterplot with a fitted line, whose slope is 0.4 and intercept is 3\nanscombe %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = x1, y = y1)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_abline(slope = 0.4, intercept = 3, col = \"blue\", size = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescribe the line that you see. Do you think the line is “good”? What are you using to define “good”?\nSome things to think about:\n\nHow many points are above the line?\nHow many points are below the line?\nAre the distances of the points above and below the line roughly similar, or is there meaningful difference?\n\nNow we’ll add another line to our plot. Which line do you think is better suited for this data? Why? Be specific!\n\n# scatterplot with a fitted line, whose slope is 0.4 and intercept is 3\nanscombe %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = x1, y = y1)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_abline(slope = 0.4, intercept = 3, col = \"blue\", size = 1) +\n  geom_abline(slope = 0.5, intercept = 4, col = \"orange\", size = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s usually quite simple to note when a line is bad, but more difficult to quantify when a line is a good fit for our data. Consider the following line:\n\n# scatterplot with a fitted line, whose slope is 0.4 and intercept is 3\nanscombe %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = x1, y = y1)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_abline(slope = -0.5, intercept = 10, col = \"red\", size = 1) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the next activity, we’ll formalize the principle of least squares, which will give us one particular definition of a line of best fit that is commonly used in statistics! We’ll take advantage of the vertical distances between each point and the fitted line (residuals), which will help us define (mathematically) a line that best fits our data:\n\nlibrary(broom)\nanscombe %&gt;%\n  lm(y1 ~ x1, data = .) %&gt;%\n  augment() %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = x1, y = y1)) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) +\n  geom_segment(aes(xend = x1, yend = .fitted), col = \"red\") +\n  geom_point()",

Go back to using the bikes dataset (instead of bikes_sub) because we no longer need to only keep days less than 80 degrees.\n\n# Construct and interpret a visualization of this relationship\n# Include a representation of the relationship trend\nggplot(bikes, aes(x = windspeed, y = riders_registered)) + \n    geom_point() + \n    geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"red\", se = FALSE) +\n    geom_smooth(color = \"blue\", se = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Use lm to construct a model of riders_registered vs windspeed\n# Save this as bike_mod2\nbike_mod2 &lt;- lm(riders_registered ~ windspeed, data = bikes)\n\n# Get a short summary of this model\ncoef(summary(bike_mod2))\n##               Estimate Std.

(0 is a little below the minimum of the observed data, but not by much! So extrapolation in interpreting the intercept isn’t a huge concern.)\nSlope: Every 1mph increase in windspeed is associated with a ridership decrease of 65 riders on average.\n\nSee the code below to predict ridership on August 17, 2012 and calculate the corresponding residual. Note that this residual is smaller than the residual from the temperature model (that residual was 3496.731). This indicates that August 17 was more of an outlier in ridership given the temperature than the windspeed.\n\n\nbikes %&gt;% \n    filter(date == \"2012-08-17\") %&gt;% \n    select(riders_registered, windspeed)\n## # A tibble: 1 × 2\n##   riders_registered windspeed\n##               &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n## 1              5665      15.5\n\n# prediction\n4490.09761 - 65.34145 * 15.50072\n## [1] 3477.258\n\n# residual \n5665 - 3477.258\n## [1] 2187.742",

This line seems way off base, comparatively!\n\nThe takeaway message here is that even though both of these additional points might be considered “outliers” because they have extreme x values, one changes the relationship between x and y much more than the other. In this case, the second point we considered would be influential because it changes the observed relationship between all x’s and y’s much more than the first point we considered.

    "section": "Model Assumptions",
    "text": "Model Assumptions\nOne way to think about model evaluation is to consider whether or not underlying assumptions of our regression models are being met (or not). Asking ourselves if our models are “wrong”, “strong”, and “fair” approaches this from one perspective. To the first question (whether our model is wrong), recall the following four assumptions of linear regression:\n\nLinearity\nIndependence\nNormality\nEqual Variance\n\nNote that they spell “LINE” (how convenient!).\nBy assumptions, we mean that the above four “things” are needed mathematically in order for linear regression to “work”.\nWhereas we can check some of these assumptions using a residual plot, we need to examine the context of our data collection when checking the Independence assumption. What we mean by independence, is that the residuals in our model do not depend on one another. This may seem like an unsatisfying definition, so here are some examples:\n\nSuppose I want to understand the association between a person’s high school GPA and their college GPA. I collect data from every graduating senior, at three different high schools. If I have college GPA as my outcome, and high school GPA as my predictor, are my residuals independent? Probably not! It is reasonable to believe that students from the same high school may have similar GPAs, due to resources their high school may have had available, or specific teachers grading differently at one school or another. This is an example of clustering, where we have clusters of students within schools. The independence assumption of our linear regression model would be violated. One way to address this would be to include which high school they went to as an additional covariate in our regression model (we’ll get to this with multiple linear regression), and more advanced methods are covered in a course on Correlated Data.\nSuppose I want to understand the association between a mouse’s weight and their water consumption across time. I collect data for 365 days for ten different mice, recording their weight and water consumption each day of the year. If I have weight as my predictor and water consumption as my outcome, are my residuals independent? Nope! This is an example of correlated data that is longitudinal in nature: I have multiple observations per individual (mouse) across time. A mouse’s weight one day is certainly not independent of it’s weight the following day. The independence assumption of our linear regression model would again be violated. One way to address this would be to include “Mouse ID” as a predictor in our regression model (again, we’ll get to this with multiple linear regression).\n\nAll types of data that will violate the independence assumption of linear regression will have some sort of correlation structure (within individual, across time, across space, etc.). Think about clusters. If your observations fall neatly into specific clusters, your data may violate the independence assumption of linear regression.\nFile organization: Save this file in the “Activities” subfolder of your “STAT155” folder.",

    "section": "Exercise 5: Is the model strong? Developing R-squared intuition",
    "text": "Exercise 5: Is the model strong? Developing R-squared intuition\nThe R-squared metric is a way to quantify the strength of a model. It measures how much variation in the outcome/response variable can be explained by the variation in the predictors.\nWhere does R-squared come from? Well, it turns out that we can partition the variance of the observed response values into the variability that’s explained by the model (the variance of the predictions) and the variability that’s left unexplained by the model (the variance of the residuals):\n\\[\\text{Var(observed) = Var(predicted) + Var(residuals)}\\]\nStrong models have residuals that don’t deviate far from 0. So the smaller the variance in the residuals (thus larger the variance in the predictions), the stronger the model. Take a look at the picture below and write a few sentences addressing the following:\n\nThe two rows of plots show a stronger and a weaker model. Just by looking at the blue trend line and the dispersion of the points about the line, which row corresponds to the stronger model? How can you tell? Which row would you expect to have a higher correlation?\nWhat is different about the variance of the residuals from the first to the second row?\n\n\n\nThe first row corresponds to the weaker model. We can tell because the points are much more dispersed from the trend line than in the second row. Recall that the correlation metric measures how closely clustered points are about a straight line of best fit, so we would expect the correlation to be lower for the first row than the second row.\nThe variance of the residuals is much lower for the second row—the residuals are all quite small. This indicates a stronger model.\n\nPutting this together, the R-squared compares Var(predicted) to Var(response):\n\\[R^2 = \\frac{\\text{variance of predicted values}}{\\text{variance of observed response values}} = 1 - \\frac{\\text{variance of residuals}}{\\text{variance of observed response values}}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR-squared\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\nR^2 = 1 - \\frac{SSE}{SSTO} = 1 - \\frac{\\sum (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2}{\\sum (y_i - \\bar{y})^2}\n\\] where \\(y_i\\) are our observed outcomes, \\(i = 1, \\dots, n\\), \\(\\hat{y}_i\\) are our fitted values/predictions, and \\(\\bar{y}\\) is our observed average outcome.",

Data can reflect personal biases, institutional biases, power dynamics, societal biases, the limits of our knowledge, etc. And biased data can lead to biased analyses. Consider the example of a large company that developed a model / algorithm to review the résumés of applicants for software developer & other tech positions. The model then gave each applicant a score indicating their hire-ability or potential for success at the company. You can think of this model as something like:\n\\[E[\\text{potential | résumé features}] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 (\\text{résumé features})\\]\nSkim this Reuter’s article about the company’s résumé model.\n\nExplain why the data used by this model are not neutral.\nWhat are the potential implications, personal or societal, of the results produced from this biased data?",

    "text": "Exercise 5: Is the model strong? Developing R-squared intuition\nThe R-squared metric is a way to quantify the strength of a model. It measures how much variation in the outcome/response variable can be explained by the model.\nWhere does R-squared come from? Well, it turns out that we can partition the variance of the observed response values into the variability that’s explained by the model (the variance of the predictions) and the variability that’s left unexplained by the model (the variance of the residuals):\n\\[\\text{Var(observed) = Var(predicted) + Var(residuals)}\\]\n“Good” models have residuals that don’t deviate far from 0. So the smaller the variance in the residuals (thus larger the variance in the predictions), the stronger the model. Take a look at the picture below and write a few sentences addressing the following:\n\nThe first row corresponds to the weaker model. We can tell because the points are much more dispersed from the trend line than in the second row. Recall that the correlation metric measures how closely clustered points are about a straight line of best fit, so we would expect the correlation to be lower for the first row than the second row.\nThe variance of the residuals is much lower for the second row—the residuals are all quite small.

This requires the inclusion of the group_by() function:\n\n\n# Calculate mean price by cut\ndiamonds %&gt;% \n    group_by(cut) %&gt;% \n    summarize(mean(price))\n## # A tibble: 5 × 2\n##   cut       `mean(price)`\n##   &lt;fct&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;\n## 1 Fair              4359.\n## 2 Good              3929.\n## 3 Very Good         3982.\n## 4 Premium           4584.\n## 5 Ideal             3458.\n\n\nExamine the group mean measurements. can you match these numbers up with what you see in the plots?\nBased on the results above, we can see that, on average, diamonds with a “Fair” cut tend to cost more than higher-quality cuts. Let’s construct a new variable named cutFair, using on the following criteria:\n\n\ncutFair = 1 if the diamond is of Fair cut\ncutFair = 0 otherwise (any other value of cut (Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal))\n\nThe ifelse function allows to create a new variable from an existing one, based on whether or not the values in that variable meet a certain “condition” (remember, you can always look up function documentation in R by typing ?ifelse in the Console, and hitting enter!).\nFill in the following code to create cutFair. The condition was given to you already. Try to use this to complete the code.\n\n# In the first blank, put what value cutFair should have if the condition is \"met\", or TRUE\n# In the second blank, put what value cutFair should have if the condition is \"not met\", or FALSE\ndiamonds &lt;- diamonds %&gt;%\n  mutate(cutFair=ifelse(cut == \"Fair\", 1, 0))\n\nVariables like cutFair that are coded as 0/1 to numerically indicate if a categorical variable is at a particular state are known as an indicator variable. You will sometimes see these referred to as a “binary variable” or “dichotomous variable”; you may also encounter the term “dummy variable” in older statistical literature.\n\nNow, let’s calculate the group means based on the new cutFair indicator variable:\n\n\ndiamonds %&gt;% \n    group_by(cutFair) %&gt;% \n    summarize(mean(price))\n## # A tibble: 2 × 2\n##   cutFair `mean(price)`\n##     &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;\n## 1       0         3920.\n## 2       1         4359.",

    "text": "Exercise 5: Modeling trend using a categorical predictor with &gt;2 categories\nUsing a single binary predictor like the cutFair indicator variable is useful when there are two clearly delineated categories. However, the cut variable actually contains 5 categories! Because we’ve collapsed all non-Fair classifications into a single category (i.e. cutFair = 0), the model above can’t tell us anything about the difference in expected price between, say, Premium and Ideal cuts. The good news is that it is very straightforward to model categorical predictors with &gt;2 categories. We can do this by using the cut variable as our predictor:\n\n# Construct the model\ndiamond_mod &lt;- lm(price ~ cut, data = diamonds)\n\n# Summarize the model\ncoef(summary(diamond_mod))\n##               Estimate Std.

    "text": "Exercise 8: Modeling choices (CHALLENGE)\nWhy do we fit this model in this way (using 4 indicator variables cutGood, cutVery Good, cutPremium, cutIdeal)? Instead, suppose that we created a single variable cutCat that gave each category a numerical value: 0 for Fair, 1 for Good, 2 for Very Good, 3 for Premium, and 4 for Ideal.\n\nIf we used 0-4 instead of creating indicator variables, we would be constraining the change from 0 to 1, from 1 to 2, etc. to always be of the same magnitude. That is, a 1 unit change in the cut variable would always have the same change in price in our model.\nUsing separate indicator variables allows the difference between subsequent categories to be different, which allows our model to be a bit more nuanced. It is possible to take nuance too far though. For example, in our previous investigations of bikeshare data, we modeled ridership versus temperature. We treated temperature as a quantitative predictor. Imagine if we had created an indicator variable for each unique temperature in the data—that would be so many variables! Having so many variables creates a very complex model which can be hard to make sense of. (These ideas are addressed further in STAT 253: Statistical Machine Learning!)",

    "text": "Exercise 13: Evaluating model correctness\nSince there are only 3 different species, there are only 3 possible predictions of flipper_len in this model (one per species). Thus each of the 3 groups on the x-axis corresponds to a species. Within each species, the observed flipper_len deviates from the species-based prediction, thus so too do the residuals. That’s why the points in each group have different y coordinates.\nOverall, our model doesn’t seem too wrong! No matter the x value (species!), the residuals are normally balanced above and below 0 with roughly equal variance in each species.\n\n# Residual plot\nflipper_model_2 %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = .fitted, y = .resid)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Residual plot using boxes!\nflipper_model_2 %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x = .fitted, y = .resid, group = .fitted)) + \n  geom_boxplot() + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0)",
